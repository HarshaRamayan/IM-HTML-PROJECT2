            <h5>Major project: Design and Implementation of TARF</h5>
             Technology: .NET
             Domain: Network Security
            Description: Wireless sensor networks multi-hop routing offers protection against identity deception through replaying
            routing information. An adversary can exploit this defect to launch various harmful attacks against the routing protocols
            which includes sinkhole attacks, wormhole attacks and Sybil attacks. To secure the WSN’s against adversaries misdirecting
            the multi-hop routing, this design and implementation of “TARF” is done, it provides trustworthy and energy-efficient
            route
